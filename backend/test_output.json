  "description": "The image displays two smartphones and a debit card placed on a wooden surface. The Bank of America Visa debit card is positioned next to the phones, creating an important focal point potentially relevant for financial and transaction-related investigations. Both phones are equipped with protective casing; one appears very worn, perhaps indicating frequent use or ownership longevity. The surface shows signs of wear and tear which might suggest a high-traffic area.",
